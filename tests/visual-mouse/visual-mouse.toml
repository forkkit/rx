# NOTE: The digest file of this test had to be modified after
# recording for the test to pass in headless mode. The very
# first digest was removed. Presumably, when running in normal
# mode, there is an extra frame that is rendered. I'm not sure
# why, or what that frame contains, but for now the easy fix
# is to just remove it from the test.
